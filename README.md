# Introduction
<b>This is an example of a full game-based educational software I programmed in the army, similar to a word search puzzle.
It was programmed using Flash Builder and Adobe Animate and I worked with many parties to fully create it â€“ filming unit, graphic designers, transcribers and user experience experts.</b>

# Explanation
<ins>Since this is a military product, I cannot share the code or the product itself. Therefore,<b> I attached a demonstration video of this educational software at the bottom of this file.</b></ins>
This was an educational activity that was suitable to all those who serve in the army, which conveyed content about the Sigd holiday through a competition between two teams based on a word search puzzle. 

After the opening screens and a brief explanation of the game, the game screen appears, where you can see which team is currently playing, the word board of that team, the word they need to find, the points status for both teams and an "i" button that shows the instructions again.
Then the game begins - the procedure of the game is such that each team, on their turn, needs to find a word related to the Sigd holiday on their board.
Selecting a word on the board will be done by clicking on the first and last letters of the desired word (regardless of the order). <br>If the chosen word matches the word that needed to be found, it will be colored green and marked on the board. If not, the chosen word will be colored red for a short time, and then the team will be able to try again. 
<br>After finding the word, one of the following will appear:
1. A reading passage related to the word they found that will immediately earn the team a point.
2. A question related to the word they found with the four possible answers to this question.

In case a question appears, as soon as the playing team chooses an answer, they will receive immediate feedback: if the answer is correct, it will turn green. And if the answer is incorrect, the selected answer will turn red, and the correct answer will turn green. If the team answered correctly, they will earn a point.
Shortly thereafter, a screen explaining the correct answer will appear.

After clicking on the "x" button, whether on the correct answer explanation screen or on the reading passage screen, it will be the second team's turn to play, and their board will appear with a new word to find, and so on.

After both teams found all their words and answered all the questions, a screen will appear indicating which team won by gaining the most points in the game, along with summary screens of the educational software.

Enjoy watching!
